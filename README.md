# Python-Codes To Practice
In this Repo the all basic to advance python codes for practicing purpose 
# 1st code for practice is "EvenOdd.py"
To check the number is even or by taking input from user **or** if you want to check number by predefine value just replace 
"x = int(input("Enter the number to check if it is even or odd: "))" by e.g. " x = 13" number of your choice

# Integer Condition Checker with Flag-Based Logic

This project contains Python code for evaluating specific conditions based on two integer values and a boolean flag. The script checks whether the values meet certain sign and flag conditions and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
## Description

This integer condition checker evaluates custom conditions based on:
- **Two Integers (`a` and `b`)**: Representing any two integer values with positive or negative signs.
- **Boolean Flag**: A True/False flag used to modify the criteria for a positive or negative result.

### Conditions Checked

The script returns `True` for the following cases:
1. **Either one** (but not both) of the integers `a` or `b` is non-negative, and the flag is set to `False`.
2. **Both integers** `a` and `b` are negative, and the flag is set to `True`.

In all other cases, the script returns `False`.

### Example Usage

The program can be used to check conditions in various applications, such as:
- **Decision-making systems** where criteria depend on specific numeric signs.
- **Financial risk assessments** based on combined scores with an override flag.
- **Sensor-based systems** that depend on positive or negative thresholds with a control flag.
